#SNAKE GAME 🐍
This is a classic Snake Game built using Python.
It allows players to control a snake, eat food, and grow in size while avoiding collisions.This project was created by me as part of my learning journey in Python programming.

**PROJECT DETAILS
Programming Language: Python
Editor Used: (e.g.VSCode)
Libraries Used:PYGAME (for game development)

🎮 FEATURES
Game Mechanics: Control the snake using arrow keys.
Scoring System: Increase your score by eating the food.
Game Over Condition: Game ends when the snake hits itself or the wall.

🖥️🚀 GAME INSTRUCTIONS:
1.Use the arrow keys to control the snake ---
Up Arrow: Move up
Down Arrow: Move down
Left Arrow: Move left
Right Arrow: Move right
2.The goal is to eat the food and grow the snake.
3.Avoid running into the walls or colliding with yourself.
4.Your score increases with every piece of food the snake eats.

📚 LEARNING OUTCOMES:
1.Improved understanding of Python programming.
2.Gained hands-on experience with the Pygame library.
3.Learned how to manage game loops, detect collisions, and implement basic graphics.

🤝 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
This project was inspired by the tutorial from Code with Harry. The tutorial provided invaluable guidance and helped me build my foundation in Python game development.

📝 MORE ENHANCEMENTS IN FUTURE:
1.Add a difficulty level selector (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard).
2.Introduce sound effects for food consumption event.
3.Add a different song after one completes a certain score and the background must also change.
4.Implement a pause/resume feature.
5.Create a leaderboard system to store high scores.
6.Add multiple food types with different effects (e.g., increasing or decreasing speed).
